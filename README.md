Just learning how to use GitHub

Hello fellow nerds and geeks!

I am David Snider. I'm currently a programming student at Lewis and Clark Career Center in St. Charles, MO.
Here's a couple things about me:
  Python is so far my favorite coding language
  One of my current goals is to create a game via Python programming and attempt to get as many gamers hooked on it as I can
  I honestly hope Python becomes more popular in the business world so that I can land a good job in it.
  My other languages I would say I'm competant in are HTML and CSS
